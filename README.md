MULTIFRACTAL DETRENDED ANALYSIS OF DAILY RAINFALL DATA OF A PARTICULAR STATION FOR A PERIOD OF 20 TO 30 YEARS

# About the project
The MFDA result indicate the multifractal spectrum of precipitation deviates significantly from spectra of other climate variable. In contrast to precipitation, for global radiation, air, humidity, wind speed and air temperature, the long-range correlation prevail, with the broadness of the probability density function influencing rainfall of multifractality to a greater degree
